    "Let's now look at a nonlinear equation:\n",

    "In order to handle the quadratic extra term, we're going to add a layer of complexity by allowing our process to branch. Not only does our random walk move and die: it can also duplicate! \n",
    "\n",
    "This begs a more rigourous explanation: let $(i,j) \\in \\{1, ..., L-1\\} \\times \\{1, ..., L-1\\} $ be a position in the lattice. We introduce a sequence $(X_n)_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ of random vectors of variable dimension, the components  of which stand for the branches of our process that haven't died yet (the heads of the hydra that haven't been cut). The $(X_n)$ are defined such that:\n",
    "* The sequence starts at $(i,j)$: $X_0 = [(i,j)]$\n",
    "* For every $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, every branch can with equal probability $1/3$:\n",
    " * **Die**, in which case there is no corresponding component in the subsequent vector $X_{n+1}$.\n",
    " * **Live**: move up down, left or right with probability $1/4$ if not on the border, else stay put. The corresponding component in $X_{n+1}$ contains the new position.\n",
    " * **Duplicate**: don't move, but the next vector will have (at least) an extra component containing the branche's present coordinates.\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "How does this relate to our partial differential equation? Last time we'd introduced $u(i,j) = \\mathbb{E}[\\phi(X_T) | X_0 = (i,j)]$ with $T$ defined as $\\inf \\{n \\in \\mathbb{N} | X_n \\notin \\{0, ..., L-1\\}^2 \\} $. The function is quite similar this time, except it takes into account the branching nature of the process: the stopping time is now $T = \\inf \\{n \\in \\mathbb{N} | \\forall i,  X^{(i)}_n \\notin \\{0, ..., L-1\\}^2 \\} $. We define: $$u(i,j) = \\mathbb{E}\\big[ \\prod\\limits_{i} \\phi(X^{(i)}_n) | X_0 = [(i,j)] \\big]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, let's show that $u$ defined as above does indeed provide us with a reasonable approximation for our differential equation."
